#### Info:
- ðŸ“Œ Ruby on Rails 7.1.2
- ðŸ“Œ There are 36 or 37 weeks in a 9-month period. I have chosen 36.".
- ðŸ“Œ Usually, we pass arguments to an API. I have hardcoded them in the controller for simplicity.
- ðŸ“Œ Generating a truly random number is difficult.
- ðŸ“Œ There is no consideration for reusing fluorescent tubes. We throw them away.
- ðŸ“Œ


#### Done:

- âœ… Fluorescent tubes were broken in 1 year.
- âœ… Money do fluorescent tubes cost the University.

#### Todo:


- ðŸ’¡ Includes unit tests.
- ðŸ’¡ Improve testing (E2E, ...)
- ðŸ’¡ Includes a GitHub Actions workflow.
- ðŸ’¡ Improve Swagger UI.
- ðŸ’¡ Improve validation and naming convention.
- ðŸ’¡ Includes API versioning, rate-limiting, linter, ...

## Task

##### What
The test is to write a simulation algorithm.

##### How
Use the technology discussed in the interview for creating the solution.
Frontend - Typescript
Backend - Ruby

##### Problem
In a University, there is a classroom, in that classroom, there are 4 fluorescent tube units, each unit contains 4 fluorescent tubes.

The classroom is used 15 hours a day, 5 times a week, 9 months a year.

Every fluorescent tube works for a fixed amount of hours, that amount is returned by a function called "rand()" that returns an integer number from 100 to 200 that represents the number of hours that the fluorescent tube will work before breaking.

Once 2 fluorescent tubes fail in a single unit, you should replace all 4 tubes. Each fluorescent tube costs 7 $USD.

##### The algorithm should print:
1. How many fluorescent tubes were broken in 1 year in that classroom?
2. How much money do fluorescent tubes cost the University per year per
   classroom?
