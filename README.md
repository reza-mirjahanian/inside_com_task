#### Info:
- ðŸ“Œ Ruby on Rails 7.1.2
- ðŸ“Œ There are 36 or 37 weeks in a 9-month period. I have chosen 36.".
- ðŸ“Œ Usually, we pass arguments to an API. I have hardcoded them in the controller for simplicity.
- ðŸ“Œ Generating a truly random number is difficult.
- ðŸ“Œ There is no consideration for reusing fluorescent tubes. We throw them away.



#### Done:
- âœ… Fluorescent tubes were broken in 1 year.
- âœ… Money do fluorescent tubes cost the University.
- âœ… Add unit tests.

#### Todo:
- ðŸ’¡ Improve testing (E2E, ...)
- ðŸ’¡ Add a GitHub Actions workflow.
- ðŸ’¡ Add Swagger UI.
- ðŸ’¡ Improve validation and naming convention.
- ðŸ’¡ Include API versioning, rate-limiting, linter, ...
